# Paperclip Game

A fun incremental game built using Python and Pygame. In this game, you start by creating points and hiring workers to increase your points per second (RPS). Use your earnings to upgrade workers, acquire estates, and unlock achievements. The game includes a roulette wheel for added excitement.

## Game Mechanics

- **Workers**: Hire different types of workers, such as regular workers and grand workers, each with different costs and RPS.
- **Estates**: Buy estates that give you passive RPS over time.
- **Create Points**: Use the "CREATE" button to generate points and earn balance and score.
- **Upgrades**: Upgrade your workers and estates to increase their productivity and unlock higher rewards.
